-> Immediately / working on it
    + Make the "sec-websocket-protocol" field optional
    + Upon sending the close handshake, wait for the response for a specified
      amount of time
    + Client: check the value of "sec-websocket-location" returned by the server
    + Create an attribute that contains the sub-protocol agreed upon with the
      other side, so that the application may know which protocol it must talk

-> Soon
    + Implement proper error handling and exceptions
    + Server: receive a list of accepted hosts and check the value of the
              "host" field sent by the client against it
    + Server: receive a blacklist/whitelist of origins and check the value of
              the "origin" field sent by the client against it
    + Server: receive a list of supported sub-protocols and check the
              value of "sec-websocket-protocol" against it

-> Someday / maybe
    + Support TLS encryption (WSS - equivalent to HTTPS)
    + Support cookies
